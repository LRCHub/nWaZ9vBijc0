Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't goin' anywhere
Run 'round the town, singin' your blues
I know you ain't goin' anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Oh! Yeah! Wish!

Throw down your gun
You might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishin' well

Oh! Yeah!

But I know what you're wishin' for
(Love in a peaceful world) Yeah
(Love in a peaceful world) Oh, yeah
(Love in a peaceful world)
Mmmm mmm mmm
Mmmm mmm mmm
Na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na, na na na, na na

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishin' well

Uhh, yes!
But, uh, ow!
I wish you well

Ooh mmm, the wishing well (Ow!)
Yeah, everybody has a little wish
Yeah, everybody has a dream
Yeah, yeah, I wish you well
Ow, dream, let me dream
Your own dream
